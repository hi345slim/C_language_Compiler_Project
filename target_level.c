/* target_level.c
   Brief description of the C language level this compiler is targeting.
   Edit this file to document the exact C features and standard you'll support
   (e.g., "C89 subset", "C99 without variable length arrays", "C11 (no threads)",
   etc.)

   Example:
   Target: subset of C99 — integer/floating/string/char literals, basic arithmetic,
   function definitions, declarations, preprocessor directives, comments.
